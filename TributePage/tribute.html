                        <b>Shane Keith Warne</b>(13 September 1969 – 4 March 2022) was an Australian international
                        cricketer
                        whose career ran from 1991 to 2007. Warne played as a right-arm leg spin bowler and a
                        right-handed
                        batsman for Victoria, Hampshire and Australia. Considered to be one of the greatest bowlers in
                        the
                        history of the sport, he made 145 Test appearances, taking 708 wickets, and set the record for
                        the
                        most wickets taken by any bowler in Test cricket, a record he held until 2007. Warne was a
                        member of
                        the Australian team that won the 1999 Cricket World Cup.Warne revolutionised cricket thinking
                        with
                        his mastery of leg spin, then regarded as a dying art. After retirement, he regularly worked as
                        a
                        cricket commentator and for charities and endorsed commercial products. In recognition of his
                        skill,
                        a statue of Warne bowling was placed outside the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), where he was
                        also
                        honoured with a state memorial service, as well as having a grandstand named in his honour.
                        Warne
                        was posthumously appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for his service to
                        cricket.

                    <P>
                        <b>Shane Warne</b> was selected for the Australia B team, which toured Zimbabwe in September
                        1991.In the
                        second tour match at Harare Sports Club, Warne recorded his first first-class score of
                        five-wickets-or-more in an innings when he took 7/49 in the second innings,helping Australia B
                        to a nine-wicket win.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        <b>Shane Warne</b> had played in seven first-class matches before making his Test-level debut
                        for
                        Australia.He was called into the Australian team in January 1992 for a Test against India at
                        Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG).

                        <b>On 22 August 1992</b>, however, Warne took the last three Sri Lankan wickets without
                        conceding a run
                        in the second innings, leading to a second-innings collapse and contributing to a 16-run
                        Australian win.Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga commented in an interview; "a bowler
                        with Test average of more than 300 came and snatched the victory from our hands".

                        out English batsman Andrew Strauss at MCG in his final appearance there. This was the first
                        occasion a player had taken 700 Test wickets. The wicket was described as a "classic Warne
                        dismissal", which the crowd of 89,155 gave a standing ovation.

                    <P>
                        <b>Shane Warne</b> is widely considered as one of the greatest bowlers in cricket history.He
                        revolutionised cricket with his mastery of leg spin, which many cricket followers had come to
                        regard as a dying art due to the difficulty of accurately bowling the deliveries. Warne helped
                        overturn the domination of cricket by fast bowling that had prevailed for twenty years before
                        his debut.From the early 1990s, with the West Indies in decline, Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram of
                        Pakistan were becoming the world's most-feared fast-bowling combination. In this context,
                        Warne's bowling became significant.

                        <b>Shane Warne</b> Many of Warne's most spectacular performances occurred in Ashes series
                        against England; in particular, the "Gatting Ball", otherwise known as the "Ball of the
                        Century", which drifted significantly out of the hand, pitching well outside Leg Stump and
                        sharply spun past the front of the bat, clipping the top of Off Stump, bowling a bemused Mike
                        Gatting in the 1993 Ashes series.
